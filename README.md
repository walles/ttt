# Timed Times Tables

Hone your multiplication skills!

## TODO

### Make it playable for Johan

* Make a home screen
* Add a Start button to the home screen
* Ask ten random multiplication / division questions
* Go back to the start screen and present the result there

### Make it playable for others

* If the right answer hasn't been presented in five seconds, show the correct
  answer so that the player can type it

### Random improvements

* Make an icon
* Enable picking which multiplication tables to test
* Enable choosing between multiplication, division and both
* Enable setting the number of questions
* Avoid doing the same question twice. Might be hard with 10 questions and one
  multiplication table, let's just do our best!
* Collect high scores
  * Individual high score tables based on tables / multiplication / division
    settings
  * Sort primarily by number of first-attempt correct answers, then by
    completion time
* Keep a needs-practice list of assignments
  * When the user fails something, give it three needs-practice points
  * When the user passes something, deduct one needs-practice points
  * Try to take every other question from the needs-practice table if there's
    something in there
